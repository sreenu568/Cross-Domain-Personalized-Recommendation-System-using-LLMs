An outspoken critic of the occupation, Dr. Riyadh is equally passionate about building democracy in Iraq. Yet all around him, he sees only chaos, as his waiting room fills each day with patients suffering the physical and mental effects of ever-increasing violence. Dramatically interwoven into his personal journey is the landscape of U.S. military occupation, Australian private security contractors, and the U.N. officials who orchestrated the elections.

Dr. Riyadh, a physician and city council member, runs for a seat on the National Assembly in order to help rebuild his country.

After Mount Everest was conquered in 1953, the last great individual challenge remained the four-minute mile. While many sought to break through the most famous barrier in sporting history, it was medical student and driven amateur Roger Bannister who did it -- astounding the world. Written by renowned sportswriter Frank Deford -- don't miss one second of this remarkable achievement, both on and off the track.~~ ~"", 'Amazon.com', ""Sir Roger Bannister's historic running of the sub-four-minute mile is celebrated in"", 'Four Minutes', ', an inspiring and respectably authentic TV movie about breaking the most famous barrier in the history of sports. Although it was primarily filmed on locations near Toronto, Canada, this classy ESPN production effectively captures the melancholy mood of post-World War II England, which desperately needed a hero to lift the country out of its post-war depression. Stubbornly resistant to training, Bannister was a devoted Oxford medical student with only passing interest in athletics, but his surprising speed set the stage for his record-setting one-mile run (officially recorded as 3:59.4) at Oxford\'s modest Iffley Road track on the rainy and windy afternoon of May 6, 1954. As written by renowned sportswriter Frank Deford (based on his article ""Hillary and Bannister"") and directed by British TV veteran Charles Beeson, this handsome-looking film makes the most of its limited budget, and newcomer Jamie Maclachlan (a dead ringer for the real Bannister circa 1954) is perfectly cast, physically convincing as a world-class runner while effortlessly conveying Bannister\'s intelligent, congenial charm. Deford\'s teleplay is dryly conventional, with perfunctory parallels to Sir Edmund Hillary\'s 1953 conquest of Mount Everest (another inspirational British milestone), a fictional composite role for Christopher Plummer (doing fine work as Bannister\'s disabled coach) and a standard love interest (nicely played by Amy Rutherford, as the future Mrs. Bannister) for a touch of trackside romance.

Forensic intelligence links an Mi6 traitor to a bank account in Haiti where a case of mistaken identity introduces Bond to the beautiful but feisty Camille (OLGA KURYLENKO), a woman who has her own vendetta.

There John Coffey, a prisoner with supernatural powers, brings a sense of spirit and humanity to his guards and fellow inmates. Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast (including Michael Clarke Duncan as Coffey) in this emotional, uplifting story of guards and captives; husbands and wives; prisoners and a remarkable mouse named Mr. Jingles; and, on another level, of a moviemaker and his source. Frank Darabont returns after his 1994 directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption to adapt another Stephen King tale into a crowd-pleasing entertainment nominated for four Academy Awards?, including Best Picture.', ']]>', 'Amazon.com', '""The book was better"" has been the complaint of many a reader since the invention of movies. Frank Darabont\'s second adaptation of a Stephen King prison drama (', 'The Shawshank Redemption', ""was the first) is a very faithful adaptation of King's serial novel. In the middle of the Depression, Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) runs death row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary. Into this dreary world walks a mammoth prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Duncan) who, very slowly, reveals a special gift that will change the men working and dying (in the electric chair, masterfully and grippingly staged) on the mile . As with King's book, Darabont takes plenty of time to show us Edgecomb's world before delving into John Coffey's mystery. With Darabont's superior storytelling abilities, his touch for perfect casting, and a leisurely 188-minute running time, his movie brings to life nearly every character and scene from the novel. Darabont even improves the novel's two endings, creating a more emotionally satisfying experience. The running time may try patience, but those who want a story, as opposed to quick-fix entertainment, will be rewarded by this finely tailored tale."", '--Doug Thomas', 'On the DVD', 'Listen to our interview', 'with Frank Darabont.

While the cities were bright with light, farm families were using kerosene lanterns. Farm women on ""wash day"" pumped water by hand and heated it over a coal stove or an outside fire. Every day, the farmer and his older children pumped water for the horses and dairy cows. Without indoor plumbing, water had to be hand pumped and heated on the coal stove for the ""Saturday night baths"" in a washtub. But electric power for American farmers was on its way! In 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order creating the Rural Electrification Administration. In 1939, Pare Lorentz, the head of the United States Film Service, hired Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens to direct a film showing the advantages of bringing electricity to the farm. Ivens choose the Bill and Hazel Parkinson farm in Warnock, Ohio for this film. The resulting film Power and the Land was released in August 1940. Shown to millions of American farmers, this is the film and the family that helped electrify the American farm! Power for the Parkinsons, narrated by Walter Cronkite, tells the story of the making of that classic 1940 film.

When pop singer Vicki Robbins (Suzanna Leigh, Lust For A Vampire) arrives at the island to recuperate from nervous exhaustion, she'll soon discover that the cottage belonging to beekeeper Ralph Hargrove (Guy Doleman, Thunderball) and his wife Mary (Catherine Finn, The Creeping Flesh) is not the idyllic accommodation she'd hoped for. Following a series of deadly bee attacks, Vicki becomes an amateur detective at the urging of the island's other beekeeper, the mysterious H.W.

On discovering that her live-in boyfriend Danny (Stephen Moore) has been having an affair with her best friend, she throws him out and decides to live life on her own, independent and free. But keeping Danny out of her life and staying unfettered turns out to be much harder than she expected. Series One follows Gemma's struggle to shake Danny loose from her life and her heart where he's more difficult to dislodge. Meanwhile, in the room upstairs two flatmates, Bernadette and Josie, debate dating, romance, love and marriage. In Series Two, a fully freed-up Gemma finds herself back in the dating world and making friends with a new neighbour, Sebastian, whose close friendship and reckless love life runs on parallel - and occasionally bumping - lines. With Gemma's mother always on hand to dispense guidance, support and tales of her own love life, Solo uncovers the many surprising layers of dependence that independence brings. ...Solo - Complete Series 1 & 2 - 2-DVD Set ( Solo - Complete Series One and Two )""]",None,"{'hi_res': [None], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uyLb6QUFL.jpg'], 'thumb': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51uyLb6QUFL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg'], 'variant': ['MAIN']}","{'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}","John Abineri  (Actor, Host),     Felicity Kendal  (Actor, Host),     Gareth Gwenlan  (Director, Host)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    Unrated    Format: DVD","['Movies & TV', 'BBC', 'All BBC Titles']","{""MPAA rating"": ""Unrated (Not Rated)"", ""Package Dimensions"": ""7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.93 Ounces"", ""Director"": ""Gareth Gwenlan"", ""Media Format"": ""Import, PAL"", ""Run time"": ""395 minutes"", ""Actors"": ""John Abineri, Felicity Kendal, Elspet Gray, Stephen Moore, Michael Howe"", ""Subtitles"": ""English"", ""Producers"": ""Solo - Complete Series 1 & 2 - 2-DVD Set ( Solo - Complete Series One and Two ), Solo - Complete Series 1 & 2 - 2-DVD Set, Solo - Complete Series One and Two"", ""Language"": ""English (Dolby Digital 2.0)"", ""Studio"": ""BBC"", ""Number of discs"": ""2""}",B008I74GM0,,,

The title of the mini-series is, in the story, the nickname of a fictional Bangkok prison in which the protagonist is imprisoned, a mordant reference to Hanoi Hilton, the prison known as such used by North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.', 'Plot:', ""Bangkok Hilton begins as Hal Stanton (Denholm Elliott) leaves Bangkok by ship in the present day. He explains that he has been travelling for years, since a shameful incident when he was a prisoner of the Japanese right there in Bangkok in WWII.  He then takes us to 1960s Sydney, where he was working as a lawyer under the assumed name of Graham Greene. He falls in love with Katherine Faulkner (Judy Morris), the lovely but sheltered daughter of a wealthy family who live in a huge, isolated mansion in the outback. He visits the estate and woos Katherine and they fall passionately in love, but Hal's secret identity is soon exposed. During the war he betrayed a group of his own men, who were planning an escape, to their Japanese captors, and was later court-martialled for it. The fact that he did so to protect the rest of his men from reprisals was considered irrelevant, and he has lived with the shame ever since. Katherine's family break up the relationship and Hal moves, despondently, away. Katherine is pregnant, however, and soon gives birth to an asthmatic girl, Katrina. The young girl is raised on her own at the estate, treated as a shameful product of the illicit affair. A few years later, Katrina, now grown (Nicole Kidman), loses her mother to cancer and inherits the family fortune. Having never ventured off the estate, she travels to Sydney, where she learns that her father is not dead, as she was always told. She decides to go to London, where his family lived, to track him down.""]",39.99,"{'hi_res': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91R0zf+6cJL._SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HeI-48xxL._SL1280_.jpg', None], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AMoOtAx1L.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ljvUKV6HL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41np5dXLzYL.jpg'], 'thumb': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AMoOtAx1L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ljvUKV6HL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41np5dXLzYL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg'], 'variant': ['MAIN', 'PT01', 'PT02']}","{'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}","Nicole Kidman  (Actor),     Judy Morris  (Actor),     Ken Cameron  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    PG-13    Format: DVD","['Movies & TV', 'Genre for Featured Categories', 'Action & Adventure']","{""Is Discontinued By Manufacturer"": ""No"", ""MPAA rating"": ""PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned)"", ""Item Weight"": ""0.01 Ounces"", ""Director"": ""Ken Cameron"", ""Media Format"": ""PAL"", ""Run time"": ""260 minutes"", ""Actors"": ""Nicole Kidman, Judy Morris, Joy Smithers, Jerome Ehlers, Denholm Elliott"", ""Producers"": ""Terry Hayes, Doug Mitchell, George Miller"", ""Studio"": ""Movie Mover"", ""Number of discs"": ""2""}",B01LYJA5JS,,,

Now one of America\x92s hottest players gives you the tools you need to get over the musical speed bumps -- without crashing and burning as you go.', 'It\x92s all a matter of getting your right- and left-hand mechanics working correctly, and Steve has powerful advice and well-thought-out exercises to help you. Using tunes like ""Old Joe Clark,"" ""Soldier\x92s Joy"" and ""Big Mon"" as drills, Steve works on your hand and pick coordination and shows how to practice for best results. Tips on left-hand fretting positions (keep a light touch, very little skin on the back of the guitar neck), combined with how to hold and move your picking hand (use a wide swing with proper depth of pick; right hand should act as metronome or pendulum) help solve mechanical failures that often slow you down.', 'You\x92ll learn how to play syncopated runs and crosspicking patterns with ease, as well as a cross-picked version of ""Wildwood Flower"" that will amaze your listeners. Steve shows you how triplets and doubletime picking will help build your flatpicking technique and allow you to play blazing bluegrass instrumentals. As Steve puts it, ""once you\x92ve got the mechanics of your right hand down, it doesn\x92t care what your left hand is doing."" Then it\x92s up to you to ""oil the machinery"" by practicing, burning tunes and licks into muscle memory so you don\x92t have to think about them.

When his mother dies from a overdose, 17-year-old Josh Cody (James Frecheville) is taken in by his grandmother (Jacki Weaver) and uncles, the most notorious criminal gang in the city. So when tensions between the Codys and a squad of renegade cops land him at the center of a cold-blooded murder plot, Josh is forced to choose between his treacherous family and the lawless police in this shattering thriller.', 'Amazon.com', ""The title leaves no doubt about the nature contained in this Australian crime picture: the law of the jungle prevails, and it's kill or be killed out there. That's the belief within the Cody clan, anyway, the Melbourne criminal family whose exploits give"", 'Animal Kingdom', ""its fire. The central character is something of a deliberate vacancy, a blank slate for the movie to write on: 17-year-old Joshua, known as J (James Frechville), is taken in by his grandmother after his mother dies of an overdose (a memorably chilling opening scene). Grandma (Jacki Weaver) is known as Smurf, but don't let the name fool you: she's the Ma Barker-like matriarch of a brood of sociopaths, none more lethal than oldest son Andrew, known as the Pope (a blood-curdling performance by Ben Mendelsohn). Luke Ford and Sullivan Stapleton play her other sons, and Joel Edgerton ("", 'The Square', "") is on hand as an outlaw associate. The way J is brought in and tested in this world of blood-spattered machismo is director David Michod's subject, and even if the film has a few heavy-handed moments along the way, the overall effect is tense and unsettling. J's journey comes up short compared to a contemporaneous study of another unformed youth learning the ropes of crime (Jacques Audiard's"", 'A Prophet', ""), but its portrait of amorality thriving in a somewhat ordinary-looking urban landscape is effective.

Lewton was the producer whose low-budget unit at RKO in the forties displayed ""the most sensitive movie intelligence in Hollywood,"" according to the esteemed critic James Agee. He served his apprenticeship as David O. Selznick\'s assistant, and even suggested the famous scene at the Atlanta depot in', 'Gone With the Wind', '(although Lewton actually assumed Selznick would never shoot such an elaborate scene). At RKO, Lewton achieved greatness despite his imposed restriction: the studio would give him vulgar, exploitable titles--', 'Cat People', ', say, or', 'I Walked with a Zombie', ""--and then Lewton and his crew would make smart, visually gorgeous movies out of them. Lewton doesn't seem to have left behind a huge amount of colorful biographical anecdotes (or even that many photographs), but writer-director Kent Jones has done a splendid job of blending biographical info with film appreciation. Copious and well-chosen clips give eloquent evidence of the poetry in Lewton's approach (aided and abetted by such talented collaborators as directors Jacques Tourneur and Robert Wise, and cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca). These sorts of documentaries invariably have a few spoilers contained within, and anyway you'll enjoy it more if you've already seen Lewton's movies.

Aided only by the beam of a flashlight, the bidders get a quick peek inside the units, then have mere minutes to decide if they're going to take the gamble, make a bid and see if the resulting buy is full of mostly trash... or true treasure. Storage addict and 32-year bidding veteran Darrell and his son Brandon Sheets, secondhand store owner Jarrod Schultz, entrepreneur Dave Hester and antique collector Barry Weiss return for more high-stakes fun as they try to outbid one another in the pursuit of storage treasure. Part gamblers and part detectives, these seasoned veterans negotiate the fascinating and obscure world of storage auction and consignment, with personalities as colorful and varied as the treasures they uncover."", 'Amazon.com', 'Fallen behind on your', 'Storage Wars', 'viewing? Here\'s an update: Barry paid $900 for a locker and there was nothing in it; Dave said ""yuuuup!"" and picked a fight with someone; Darrell made a couple of non sequitur asides to the camera; Brandi and Jarrod fought over a unit, but they weren\'t really fighting. No matter which episode or DVD set you\'re watching, consider yourself caught up with that recap. Nevertheless, rabid fans of this addictive show will still want to include volume three for some binge viewing, whether it\'s a guilty pleasure or an unabashed obsession. The premise of this irresistible reality show gathers a gang of four second-hand-goods dealers as they trek around Southern California plundering the thousands of storage lockers that go on the auction block each year after the renters default or disappear. They\'re allowed a quick peek with a flashlight when the lock is cut and the door raised, then it\'s on to the cutthroat bidding between the main characters as they gleefully and often greedily describe what treasures they think might be inside. Is it a fortune in expensive electronics? A cache of rare coins? Jewels? Antique furniture? Some bizarre medical device? Shrunken heads? It could be any of the above or just as likely a few musty cardboard boxes or plastic containers filled with nothing but dust. The show\'s structure provides a nicely devised feeling of suspense--it really could be anything inside these dark closets that hold weird secrets from other people\'s lives. But it\'s the personalities of the bidders that keep you coming back for more', 'Storage Wars', 'and its can\'t-look-away formula. Barry is ""the Collector,"" a flamboyant, charming, sixtyish gentleman with style and personality galore. He\'s not so much interested in striking it rich as finding something crazy or unique. Barry is a funny, likable guy who also tends to be a soothing, comic mediator when things get heated. Dave is ""the Mogul,"" an aggressive, brash, serious entrepreneur who is all in for the money, not the sport. Dave has the annoying catch phrase (""Yuuuup!"") and is easily antagonized, especially when his ongoing feud with Darrell flares into an angry exchange. Darrell is ""the Gambler,"" a big burly bear of a blue-collar workingman who\'s always looking for the big score. He particularly enjoys getting Dave\'s goat and will frequently engage in a bidding war either man might escalate only to give the other guy a reason to start steaming. Jarrod and Brandi own a small shop and are always looking to keep their shelves stocked with tchotchkes and collectibles that aren\'t just scrap or throwaway Goodwill-type household goods. Always involved in some sort of dispute, each one thinks that they\'re the one in charge. It\'s clear they\'re a loving, devoted couple and that the sniping is pretty much an act, with Jarrod as the crazy and Brandi as the voice of reason.

The story concerns four Atlanta businessmen of various male stripe: Jon Voight's character is a reflective, civilized fellow, Burt Reynolds plays a strapping hunter-gatherer in urban clothes, Ned Beatty is a sweaty, weak-willed boy-man, and Ronny Cox essays a spirited, neighborly type. Together they decide to answer the ancient call of men testing themselves against the elements and set out on a treacherous ride on the rapids of an Appalachian river. What they don't understand until it is too late is that they have ventured into Dickey's variation on the American underbelly, a wild, lawless, dangerous (and dangerously inbred) place isolated from the gloss of the late 20th century. In short order, the four men dig deep into their own suppressed primitiveness, defending themselves against armed cretins, facing the shock of real death on their carefully planned, death-defying adventure, and then squarely facing the suspicions of authority over their concealed actions. Boorman, a master teller of stories about individuals on peculiarly mythical journeys, does a terrifying and beautiful job of revealing the complexity of private and collective character--the way one can never be the same after glimpsing the sharp-clawed survivor in one's soul."", '--Tom Keogh', 'On the DVD', 'The single-disc deluxe edition of', 'Deliverance', 'has plenty to recommend it over the previously released DVD.

A 2007 55-minute documentary is split into four parts: The Beginning, The Journey, Betraying the River (focusing on the ""squeal like a pig"" scene), and Delivered.

King Joao The First ordered construction of the Palacio Nacional De Sintra on the foundations of a Moorish construction that dated back to the 10th century. From the palace there's a beautiful view across the Vila Velha, Sintra's old town. The Palacio Nacional De Sintra consists of a variety of architectural styles that include Moorish, Gothic and Manuelistic design. 530 metres above sea level, on the summit of the Sintra Mountains, the spectacular Palacio Nacional De Pena overlooks the town. At first sight its towers resemble minarets, a symbol of a courageous and successful combination of numerous architectural traditions. Three kilometres from the castle is the oldest building in Sintra, the towers and walls of a Moorish castle, the Castelo Dos Mouros. The thousand year old ruins are famous for their breathtaking views that extend for several kilometres across the landscape and even as far as the Atlantic Ocean. In 1147, King Alfonso and his army conquered the old fortress. Sintra's gardens are the most beautiful in Europe and due to the region's unique climate, subtropical plants flourish in the fertile volcanic earth close to the Atlantic Ocean. Beneath the southern sun, Sintra's historic architecture continues to blend harmoniously with the glorious splendour of Nature. Global Treasures - History's Most Protected Monuments - Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live today, and what we pass on to future generations. our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration.

Despite growing up around movie stars and experiencing early fame of her own (she was cast as Princess Leia in Star Wars at 19), Fisher's life was hardly enviable. She faced more than her share of challenges: tragic relationships, drug and alcohol addiction, stints in rehab, bipolar disorder, and electroshock therapy. That she has survived and even prospered in the face of such adversity is a tribute to Fisher's resiliency, intelligence and, above all, heroic sense of humor.

Movies & TV,Inland Empire,4.5,844,[],"['Product Description', 'A magikael, fairy dusted ride through the darkest realms of our collective imaginations. Terrifying!', 'Amazon.com', 'Though', 'Inland Empire', ""'s three hours of befuddling abstraction could try the patience of the most devoted David Lynch fan, its aim to reinvigorate the Lynch-ian symbolic order is ambitious, not to mention visually arresting. The director's archetypes recognizable from previous movies once again construct the film's inherent logic, but with a new twist. Sets vibrate between the contemporary and a 1950s alternate universe crammed with dim lamps, long hallways, mysterious doors, sparsely furnished rooms and, this time, a vortex/apartment/sitcom set where rabbit-masked humans dwell, and a Polish town where women are abused and killed. Instead of speaking backwards, mystic soothsayers and criminals speak Polish. Filmed on video, the film's look has the sinister, frightening feel of a Mark Savage film or a bootlegged snuff movie. Constant close-ups, both in and out of focus, make Inland Empire feel as if a stalker covertly filmed it. A straightforward, hokey plot unravels during the first third of Inland Empire to ground the viewer before a dive off the deep end. Actor Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) is cast as Susan Blue, an adulterous white trash Southerner, in a film that mimics too closely her actual life with an overbearingly jealous and dangerous husband. When Nikki and co-star Devon (Justin Theroux) learn that the cursed film project was earlier abandoned when its stars were murdered, the pair lose their grasp of reality. Nikki suffers a schizophrenic identity switch to Sue that lasts until nearly the film's end. Suspense builds as Nikki's alter ego sleuths her way through surreal situations to discover her killer, culminating in Sue's gnarly death on set. Sue's actions drag on because any sign of a narrative thread disappears due to idiosyncratic editing. Nonsensical scenes still captivate, however, such as when Sue stumbles onto the soundstage where she finds Nikki (herself) rehearsing for Sue's part.

Yet, despite all his efforts, this 34-year-old Bronx butcher remains as shy and uncomfortable around women today as on the day he was born. So when he meets Clara (Betsy Blair, A Delicate Balance), a lonely schoolteacher who’s just as smitten with him as he is with her, Marty’s on top of the world. But not everyone around him shares Marty’s joy. And when his friends and family continually find fault with Clara, even Marty begins to question his newfound love—until he discovers, in an extraordinary way, the strength and courage to follow his heart. Nominated for eight Academy Awards and winner of four, including Best Actor for Borgnine, Best Director for Delbert Mann (Separate Tables) and Best Screenplay for Paddy Chayefsky (Network), Marty is a masterpiece of warmhearted storytelling.', 'Special Features:-Brand New 4K Master -NEW Audio Commentary by Entertainment Journalists/Authors Bryan Reesman and Max Evry -Includes Both the 1.85:1 and 1.37:1 Versions of the Film -Theatrical Trailer -Optional English Subtitles']",20.99,"{'hi_res': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sF-RRRsyL._SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81CMMQu71YL._SL1500_.jpg'], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41srWNJPjVL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51o0nMoidZL.jpg'], 'thumb': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41srWNJPjVL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51o0nMoidZL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg'], 'variant': ['MAIN', 'FRNT']}","{'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}","Delbert Mann  (Director),     Ernest Borgnine  (Actor),     Betsy Blair  (Actor)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    NR    Format: Blu-ray","['Movies & TV', 'Blu-ray', 'Movies']","{""Genre"": ""Drama, Romance"", ""Contributor"": ""Esther Minciotti, Karen Steele, James Bell, Paddy Chayefsky, Augusta Ciolli, Delbert Mann, Ernest Borgnine, Betsy Blair, Jerry ParisEsther Minciotti, Karen Steele, James Bell, Paddy Chayefsky, Augusta Ciolli, Delbert Mann, Ernest Borgnine, Betsy Blair, Jerry Paris  See more"", ""Language"": ""English"", ""Runtime"": ""1 hour and 30 minutes"", ""Aspect Ratio"": ""1.37:1, 1.85:1"", ""MPAA rating"": ""NR (Not Rated)"", ""Product Dimensions"": ""7 x 5 x 1 inches; 2.75 Ounces"", ""Director"": ""Delbert Mann"", ""Run time"": ""1 hour and 30 minutes"", ""Release date"": ""July 19, 2022"", ""Actors"": ""Ernest Borgnine, Betsy Blair, Esther Minciotti, Jerry Paris, Karen Steele"", ""Studio"": ""KL Studio Classics"", ""Country of Origin"": ""USA"", ""Number of discs"": ""1""}",B09YS2RJFW,,,

Movies & TV,Sum of the Parts [Blu-ray],4.6,295,[],"['""Sum of the Parts"" is the official authorized story of Genesis made with the full co-operation of the band members. As seen on SHOWTIME, It tells of the band\'s formation at Charterhouse (where Tony Banks, Peter Gabriel and Mike Rutherford were all pupils) in the late sixties and the release of their debut album ""From Genesis to Revelation"". The story then moves on through the departure of founder member Anthony Phillips and the arrival of Phil Collins and Steve Hackett in 1970 to form the 5-man line-up that established the band\'s career with albums such as ""Foxtrot"" and ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"". Peter Gabriel\'s departure in 1975 and then Steve Hackett\'s in 1977 led to the release of the album ""And Then There Were Three..."" and a move towards shorter, more immediate songs. The eighties and nineties were triumphant decades for Genesis with hugely successful hit albums and singles around the world such as ""Genesis"", ""Invisible Touch"" and ""We Can\'t Dance"". at the same time as they were recording and performing with Genesis, Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford (as Mike & the Mechanics) were all enjoying successful solo careers, as were departed members Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett. ""Sum of the Parts"" explores the dynamics of the group that has enabled them to survive changes of line-up, see their musical direction steadily evolve and maintain both group and solo careers along with their enduring popularity as evidenced by their hugely successful 2007 reunion tour.

""What on Earth,"" Oscar nomination 1965.', 'Amazon.com', 'All the National Film Board of Canada shorts on this disc earned Oscar nominations, and ""Neighbors"" (1952) won an Academy Award. Norman McLaren, who founded the animation unit of the NFB, used pixilation (stop motion photography of live actors), to present a pointed tale of human aggression in ""Neighbors."" An important film in the history of animation, it helped to establish the international reputation of the NFB. Most of the other films involve unusual techniques. ""Hunger"" (1974) by Peter Foldes remains a landmark of early computer animation, although modern audiences may find it ugly and heavy-handed. Ishu Patel uses a complex array of media and technical tricks to present a ravishing vision of an enchanted Moghul palace and the wondrous bird that inhabits it in ""Paradise"" (1984). Sadly, the lack of a coherent story weakens this lovely film. More satisfying is Patel\'s ""The Bead Game"" (1977), in which he manipulates thousands of tiny glass beads to present a series of striking images of evolution and destruction. ""This Is the House That Jack Built"" (1968) and ""What on Earth!"" (1967) use the simplified graphics pioneered by UPA and the Hubley Studio to spoof problems of Western civilization, although ""What on Earth!"" seems fresher and funnier more than 30 years later.

COUNTRY MUSIC: LIVE AT THE RYMAN: On March 27, 2019, acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns invited some of country music's finest artists to gather at Nashville's historic Ryman Auditorium to celebrate the launch of his landmark PBS series Country Music. Burns and his longtime collaborator Dayton Duncan curated an evening of selected highlights from the series combined with performances of the music's iconic songs by some of country's finest artists. Among those performing on stage that night were Dierks Bentley, Rosanne Cash, Rodney Crowell, Rhiannon Giddens, Vince Gill, Kathy Mattea, Ketch Secor, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Holly Williams, and Dwight Yoakam. The result is a musical journey tracing the evolution of country music and its many branches and highlighting its foundational stars: songs from Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family to Hank Williams and Bob Wills, Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash, from Bill Monroe and Patsy Cline to Dolly Parton and Kris Kristofferson and Merle Haggard -- and many more. KEN BURNS: COUNTRY MUSIC: Ken Burns' eight-part, 16-hour documentary series, COUNTRY MUSIC, chronicles the history of a uniquely American art form, focusing on the biographies of the fascinating characters who created it. More than eight years in the making, the film follows the evolution of country music from its diverse and humble origins as it emerged, by the end of the twentieth century, into a worldwide phenomenon. Filled with memorable musical moments, interviews with more than 80 country music artists, and evocative footage and photographs - many never seen before - it weaves an unforgettable story that is both intimate and sweeping.

It's difficult to understand why anyone would choose to put themselves through 197 miles of running on back-roads and highways in the middle of the night, with barely any sleep, crammed in a van, but that is the stark reality of the Hood To Coast race. Each year 12,000 people descend on sleepy Oregon forests to make the trek that is not about winning, but a personal journey. Here, the runners tell the story in their own words. Through the mental and physical struggle of this race, the runners look for new strength within themselves and find joy on the beautiful trek through Oregon. For each individual, the race becomes a great symbol of their tenacity and ability to do something they were told was improbable, impossible, or simply unheard of. Alone, no one could run 197 miles, but with positive attitude and the support of a team, anything is possible. While some teams focus all year on training for Hood To Coast, some have never run in their lives.""]",None,"{'hi_res': [None], 'large': [None], 'thumb': [None], 'variant': ['MAIN']}","{'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}",,['Documentary'],"{""Subtitles"": [""None available""], ""Directors"": [""Christoph Baaden"", ""Marcie Hume""], ""Producers"": [""Anna Campbell""], ""Starring"": [""Alberto Salazar"", ""Bart Yasso"", ""Rachel Larsen""]}",B00EFZT6YW,,,

Pint-sized gumshoe Conan Edogawa is on the case, but there's more to this mystery than anyone suspects. The good guys seem bad and the bad guys seem good, and not even the boy detective knows who to trust. Worse yet, a rogue sniper is making sure anyone in the way catches a bullet dead in the eye. Things are heating up, and Conan's gonna need help to uncover the Last Wizard of the Century!"", 'Amazon.com', 'In the third', 'Case Closed', 'movie,', 'The Last Wizard of the Century', '(1999), diminutive detective Conan Edogawa (teenage ace sleuth Jimmy Kudo) tackles one of the most complex cases in his career. The mystery centers on a previously unknown Fabergé Easter egg, the last treasure the legendary jeweler created for Tsar Nicholas II to give the Empress Alexandra. Curiously, the golden egg is set with pieces of glass, rather than diamonds. Initially, Detective Moore, joined by Rachel, Conan, Harley, and the rest of the cast, is assigned to protect the ""Memories"" Egg from Conan\'s nemesis, the brilliant young magician, master of disguise, and cat burglar the Phantom Thief Kid (a.k.a. the Kaitou Kid), who debuted in season 3 of the long-running television show. But as the complications multiply, Conan discovers there\'s much more at stake, including a second egg and the only descendant of a long-lost Romanov princess. Director Kenji Kodama keeps the action moving while sorting through the layers of Kazunari Kouchi\'s intricate screenplay. Conan risks revealing his true identity after he saves Rachel from a would-be assassin, but the Kaitou Kid bails him out at the last second. Conan and Kaitou grudgingly admire each other\'s intelligence, skill, and imagination, and voice actor Jerry Jewell once again plays both rivals with almost tangible relish.', 'Last Wizard of the Century', 'will leave', 'Case Closed', 'fans eager for more mysteries in which, inevitably, ""One Truth Prevails!""

The case, originally front-page news across the country when Kennedy nephews Tommy and Michael Skakel became prime suspects, had been all but forgotten.

Fuhrman heads east, where his presence causes friction with the local law. But with the help of a retired cop (Robert Forster) who worked on the case, Fuhrman cuts through a maze of mismanaged investigations and cover-ups to place new suspicion on Moxley's wastrel neighbors, the Skakel brothers, who have familial ties to the Kennedys.

Martin Sheen stars as Army Captain Willard, a troubled man sent on a dangerous and mesmerizing odyssey into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade American colonel named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has succumbed to the horrors of war and barricaded himself in a remote outpost.', 'Amazon.com', 'Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now: Redux', 'In the tradition of such obsessively driven directors as Erich von Stroheim and Werner Herzog, Francis Ford Coppola approached the production of', 'Apocalypse Now', 'as if it were his own epic mission into the heart of darkness. On location in the storm-ravaged Philippines, he quite literally went mad as the project threatened to devour him in a vortex of creative despair, but from this insanity came one of the greatest films ever made. It began as a John Milius screenplay, transposing Joseph Conrad\'s classic story ""Heart of Darkness"" into the horrors of the Vietnam War, following a battle-weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) on a secret upriver mission to find and execute the renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has reverted to a state of murderous and mystical insanity. The journey is fraught with danger involving wartime action on epic and intimate scales. One measure of the film\'s awesome visceral impact is the number of sequences, images, and lines of dialogue that have literally burned themselves into our cinematic consciousness, from the Wagnerian strike of helicopter gunships on a Vietnamese village to the brutal murder of stowaways on a peasant sampan and the unflinching fearlessness of the surfing warrior Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who speaks lovingly of ""the smell of napalm in the morning."" Like Herzog\'s Aguirre: The Wrath of God, this film is the product of genius cast into a pit of hell and emerging, phoenix-like, in triumph. Coppola\'s obsession (effectively detailed in the riveting documentary', 'Hearts of Darkness', "", directed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor) informs every scene and every frame, and the result is a film for the ages. --"", 'Jeff Shannon']",16.3,"{'hi_res': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cm9DuCT3L._SL1500_.jpg', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ihs1o7ZtL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412VNO72aoL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417nLskXlGL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kQCPr2rzL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513mZvM+INL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AIFRfd4RL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41n5GCfdp4L.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/319O1RnNf1L.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KhtUbsg-L.jpg'], 'thumb': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ihs1o7ZtL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412VNO72aoL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/417nLskXlGL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kQCPr2rzL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513mZvM+INL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41AIFRfd4RL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41n5GCfdp4L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/319O1RnNf1L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KhtUbsg-L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg'], 'variant': ['MAIN', 'PT01', 'PT02', 'PT03', 'PT04', 'PT05', 'PT06', 'PT07', 'PT08']}","{'title': ['Apocalypse Now [Blu-ray] Trailer'], 'url': ['https://www.amazon.com/vdp/c1b92b55186049f4804532a5c717bf48?ref=dp_vse_rvc_0'], 'user_id': ['']}","Martin Sheen  (Actor),     Marlon Brando  (Actor),     Francis Ford Coppola  (Director)    &                   0                  more   Rated:    R    Format: Blu-ray","['Movies & TV', 'Blu-ray', 'Movies']","{""Genre"": ""Drama"", ""Format"": ""Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, DTS Surround SoundMultiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound  See more"", ""Contributor"": ""Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando"", ""Language"": ""English"", ""Runtime"": ""3 hours and 22 minutes"", ""Aspect Ratio"": ""2.35:1"", ""Is Discontinued By Manufacturer"": ""No"", ""MPAA rating"": ""R (Restricted)"", ""Product Dimensions"": ""0.7 x 7.5 x 5.4 inches; 3.2 Ounces"", ""Item model number"": ""11318571"", ""Director"": ""Francis Ford Coppola"", ""Media Format"": ""Multiple Formats, AC-3, Blu-ray, Closed-captioned, Dolby, NTSC, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, DTS Surround Sound"", ""Run time"": ""3 hours and 22 minutes"", ""Release date"": ""October 19, 2010"", ""Actors"": ""Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando"", ""Subtitles"": ""English, French, Spanish"", ""Studio"": ""Lions Gate"", ""Number of discs"": ""2""}",B003XMXZCW,,,

It is the best way to be prepared and to create wonderful flying experiences.', 'Phantom 4 Lesson One Getting Setup (18 minutes)', 'The Phantom 4 is a significant upgrade with object detection and avoidance. In addition, are the new features Tap Fly (flies to the destination you point to on your screen) and ActiveTrack (follows a person or object you select).', 'In this lesson we go over some basics such as learning to charge the batteries and power up the Phantom and the controller. Downloading the Go App and installing the firmware is demonstrated.', 'Lesson 1 Chapters 1. Overview 2. Charging 3. Go App Install 4. Gimbal Lock 5. Firmware upgrade', 'Phantom 4 Lesson Two The Go App (68 minutes) In this video I go over the various menus in the Camera View of the Go App. The lesson includes insights into what settings might work better for you. The video also covers settings for the aircraft s camera and video.', 'Lesson 2 Chapters 1. Overview 2. Flight Mode (Opti) Menu 3. Obstical Sensing Menu 4. Safe to Fly Menu 5.

There is a flight explaining and demonstrating how to use Course Lock and Home Lock. There are also fights demonstrating Point of Interest, TapFly and ActiveTrack.', 'Lesson 3 Chapters 1. Overview 2. First Flight 3. Intelligent Navigation 4. Return to Home 5. TapFly 6. ATTI Mode & Sport Mode 7. ActiveTrack 8. Concluding Remarks', 'DJI Intelligent Navigation Demonstration (26 minutes) The advanced features are fun to use and with instruction, easy to learn. However, there are factors that are not completely intuitive. While the advanced features do help to provide a more controlled flight, these are advanced features and if used improperly they could create a crash. Watch this video so you understand how the Intelligent Navigation features work. Be sure to use the features wisely by flying in wide open areas. I do not recommend that you use the Follow Me feature or at least be extremely careful.', 'Review', ""I discovered Phantom Knowledge while researching the Phantom 3 on YouTube. After seeing the informative style of this companies YouTube productions... I purchased this training video. It was extremely enlightening and so helpful. I actually purchased this video prior to buying a Phantom 3 and I would recommend learning as much as you can prior to your purchase. This is too expensive of an investment for a hobby where you could destroy your bird with your first flight. I recommend buying this video prior to your Phantom purchase and then watching it again after purchase. There is so much good information in this training video it will save you from losing your investment. As well as eliminating a lot of stress prior to your first flight. Well Done!!! --Amazon.comI purchased Jim's training online, it's great, it's specific and Jim is a very good teacher (communicates well) which makes it very easy to learn to fly these birds! The video tutorials are specific for every area you need (the RC, the Drone, the battery, firmware updates, safety, etc.). I would highly recommend the training from Jim, and for sure before you ever get your drone off the ground! --Amazon.comMore information than I expected. DJI, manufacturer of the Phantom 3 has made changes in the firmware since the original video was produced. The video has been update with the changes by alerting the viewer with a bold graphic at the bottom of the screen indicating the change, and what you need to do with the update. --B & H Photo""]",None,"{'hi_res': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81gyQ36H-hL._SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81gyQ36H-hL._SL1500_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81M48ts3wIL._SL1500_.jpg'], 'large': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NEj17SUvL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NEj17SUvL.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bYWvNhyTL.jpg'], 'thumb': ['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NEj17SUvL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NEj17SUvL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bYWvNhyTL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg'], 'variant': ['MAIN', 'FRNT', 'BACK']}","{'title': [], 'url': [], 'user_id': []}","James Bendewald  (Actor, Director)    Format: DVD","['Movies & TV', 'Genre for Featured Categories', 'Special Interests']","{""Format"": ""NTSC, Full Screen"", ""Contributor"": ""James Bendewald"", ""Number Of Discs"": ""2"", ""Runtime"": ""2 hours and 22 minutes"", ""Publication Date"": ""April 18, 2016"", ""Package Dimensions"": ""7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.93 Ounces"", ""Item model number"": ""Step-By-Step Training"", ""Director"": ""James Bendewald"", ""Media Format"": ""NTSC, Full Screen"", ""Run time"": ""2 hours and 22 minutes"", ""Release date"": ""April 18, 2016"", ""Actors"": ""James Bendewald"", ""Studio"": ""James Studio"", ""Number of discs"": ""2""}",B01EP76MEG,,,
