Kinsella""}","""Dance Me Outside"" was a fantastic Canadian film from 1994 based on the novel of the same name by W.P. Kinsella. Directed by Bruce McDonald and co-written by Don McKellar (""Last Night,"" ""The Red Violin""), the film centers around Frank Fencepost and Silas Crow, two young adults on a reserve in northern Ontario, planning on going to college in Toronto to become mechanics. We are introduced early on to their family and (girl)friends, and the tragic act that sets the tone occurs early on in the film. ""Dance Me Outside"" inspired the (Canadian) TV series ""The Rez"" (1996) which featured many of the same actors and characters (Frank, Silas, Sadie, Joseph, Etta).<br />The film opens with a shot of Silas Crow crouched down staring at his namesake, accompanied by a native flute and a voiceover. Throughout the film there are ties between the spiritual and the natural, whether it is Illiana's mother telling her that babies come from the Great Spirit or the predictions of Mad Etta. The scenes of Robert McVey, Illiana's white Torontonian yuppie lawyer husband, being ""initiated"" into the tribe as a ruse for Gooch (Illiana's old flame who was just released from jail) to impregnate Illiana, border on the absurd, representing white stereotypes of First Nations and vice versa, but there is a power, a lack of inhibition and an attempt to become one with nature, that makes it moving.<br />""Dance Me Outside"" features many talented First Nations actors: Adam Beach (who was also in the award-winning ""Smoke Signals""), Ryan Rajendra Black, Jennifer Podemski, Michael Greyeyes, Selim Running Bear Sandoval, and Vince Manitowabi among them.<br />The music was equally excellent, from a variety of bands such as Kashtin, the Vern Cheechoo Band, Joanne Shenandoah, the Headstones, Keith Secola, and R. Carlos Nakai.<br />In some ways I preferred this film to the much-hyped ""Smoke Signals"" based on the strength of the screenplay, the cinematography, and the realistic depiction and treatment of current First Nations social issues. There is some violence, vandalism, nudity, and swearing, but this is a touching, powerful film about community, strength, love and tradition."

Solid character actor Cesare Danova brings along his subtle Latin lover vibe; William Demarest (Uncle Charlie of TV's My Three Sons) delivers his usual quota of cranky laughs; and Nicky Blair makes a fine comic foil/sidekick for EP.  The soundtrack is one of Elvis' best of the era, a nice blend of original ballads (Today, Tomorrow and Forever; I Need Somebody to Lean On), made-to-order movie rockers (If You Think I Don't Need You; C'mon, Everybody), and the massively successful double-a-side lead single (Viva Las Vegas c/w What'd I Say?).

Who dropped the ball at RCA back in the day?"

Rumor Has It, while not a sequel, has similarities to the classic film ""The Graduate"" and the latter is mentioned several times in this movie.<br /><br />As everyone knows, The Graduate centered around a young man who falls for the seduction of an older woman named Mrs. Robinson and then later falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. In Rumor Has It, a similar situation occurs, except this time around it's Kevin Costner playing the role of ladies man and this time the main character nabs three different generations of a family rather than only two. Jennifer Aniston- one of the few bright spots in this film- falls for the charms of Costner's character and she continues the trend, in spite of the fact that just moments earlier she thought he was her biological father.<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is a little bit interesting but I don't like the way Rob Reiner pulls it all together. The film starts out with good intentions as Aniston's character goes off on a manhunt, hoping to discover that a total stranger is her real father so that she will finally understand once and for all why she is so different from the rest of her family. But rather than make this into an intriguing movie full of personal drama and suspense, Reiner decides to make it a light hearted comedy that starts out running and then slams into a concrete wall about midway through. Once the question about whether or not Kevin Costner is Jennifer Aniston's father has been answered, the movie really loses steam. Reiner doesn't do much else with the movie at this point, allowing it to fizzle out for the next thirty to forty minutes.<br /><br />This movie has been classified as a romantic comedy but it really isn't that funny. I think I counted one funny line through the entire movie (a toast made by Shirley MacLaine to her soon to be married granddaughter Annie). But at the same time, this isn't really a drama either because it lacks the involvement and seriousness one would expect in a good family drama. Again, Reiner let this aspect of the movie get away from him. I'm quite surprised by this, because usually Rob Reiner can be counted on to make some good, solid movies whether they are comedies or serious in nature.<br /><br />Among the performances, only Jennifer Aniston and Shirley MacLaine are up to snuff. The other performances are not very memorable and Mark Ruffalo's character doesn't have much chemistry with Aniston's at all. They don't seem like a good couple and I didn't find myself cheering them on or hoping they would work things out in the end and become the happily married couple that Aniston's parents were not. I really didn't care at this point.<br /><br />Overall, Rumor Has It is a sub- par film that ranks among Rob Reiner's weaker efforts. I wouldn't say it's a total dud because I have seen worse films during the past year. But with an all- star cast like this and with someone with Reiner's experience behind the camera, I expected it to be much better than it turned out."

I gave it four stars because the previous seasons made this a much watch season even if it wasn't as good as the first two it still brought some closure and created some openings. I could be wrong but I'm hoping there more from these actors and their characters.

In their culture, girls don't ride bikes.  Wadjda seems the rebellious youngster, and we get that quickly in the story.  We also get some references to the culture, especially how women are viewed.  Some images you need to pick up on your own, others, I felt were not defined for the viewing audience that is foreign to Saudia Arabia.  Wadjda lives with her parents, but apparently the marriage of mother and father is in slight turmoil.<br /><br />But, she wants a bike and is willing to go after it.  Ok, so she tries to sell her little craft, and then enters a Koran contest at school.  She remains determined against any odds she encounters.<br /><br />Ok.....  when I refer to a movies that does not &#34;grab&#34; one, I mean that throughout a film, one should be engrossed, feel for the child, like or dislike the child, and feel an emotional hold on the storyline.  ....  None of this,  it was slow, and quite not interesting.  I was quite taken by the images of the country.<br /><br />But, could I watch it again??  No.  Rizzo"

It is an actual concert in its entirety in front of an audience.  One of the great things about the tribute or special moments DVD collections is that you get to back in time if you wish.  Many of the veterans are here, including those who have left to see the Lord.  And if you treasure the Homecoming Concerts with the classic veterans, this is one to see.<br /><br />Taped in 1996, the veterans include:  Jake Hess, James & Terry Blackwood, the Goodmans, Brock & Ben Speer, Eva Mae LeFevre, George Younce, The Martins, Sue Dodge, Janet Pascal, Rex Nelon, and Dottie Rambo, Gaither Vocal Band; Ivan Parker; Jimmy Jones; Babbie Mason, J.D. Sumner, Lilli Knauls, Jack Toney, etc,.  You will enjoy comedy with Mark Lowry sporting a Jake Hess Wig. You get the picture what a collection of old favorites are here.<br /><br />With the taping in 1996, there seems to be something missing, but I can't place it.  Regardless, it is always good to sing along with the Homecoming Friends. Testimony is given by Donnie Sumner, J.D.'s nephew.<br /><br />Some favorite songs include ""This Ole House"" by the Cathedrals, ""Suppertime"" by Jimmy Jones;  ""Sweetest Song I Know"" ""Palms of Victory""; ""The King is Coming"", a popular Gaither-written song;  There is talk about Albert Brumley, who wrote ""I'll Fly Away"";  ""Wait Til You See Me In My New Home""<br /><br />One of my favorites songs is ""Oh Come Angel Band"" and the entire cast sings this, but it is soooo much better done with a couple of harmonies, such as on this CD [[ASIN:B000005KUN Homecoming]], my favorite version.<br /><br />God Rides on Wings of Love"";  When the Saints Go Marching In; ""Child of the King"";  The World is not My Home""  ""Ive Never Been This Homesick Before"", I Believe in the Old Time""; ""On the Sunny Banks"";  ""Leave it There"" etc.<br /><br />This is enjoyable, just to see the many performers from the earlier days of Homecoming Concerts.....Rizzo"

As a 1940s and OTR buff, this series was tailor-made for me, not to mention that one of my favorite character actors, David Wayne, was portraying Inspector Richard Queen. Jim Hutton, who I was familiar with from THE GREEN BERETS and THE HORIZONTAL LIEUTENANT, played a loveable, absent-minded, but sharp Ellery. (I found out later that the Dannay/Lee families said that Hutton's portrayal was very close to the actual personality of one of the authors.) Week after week I would ""match wits"" with Ellery and try to guess the identity of the murderer. (I even kept score in my journal; alas, in the end Ellery ""out-sleuthed"" me.) I liked best the stories where knowing a certain word or concept would give you the clue to the killer's identity.<br /><br />The guest cast was filled with delightful character actors, from the 1970s regulars of the ""Universal Studios repertory group"" as I called them, to veteran performers who went back to radio and vaudeville, like George Burns, William Frawley, Eve Arden, and Eddie Bracken, and all the 1940s settings and references were equally delightful. Along the way QUEEN satirized a number of subjects, such as Hollywood changing writers' scripts and the movie scene; addressed hot subjects of the 1940s, such as the early payola scandals and war crimes; and even presaged the comic book violence controversy of the 1950s.<br /><br />A particular delight of the series was John Hillerman's portrayal of Simon Brimmer, an unctious radio mystery story star who fancied himself a sleuth. Brimmer would somehow always come up with the wrong suspect, only to be corrected by Ellery in the climactic scene. Indeed, radio stories played a part in several of the mysteries, and many times the wordplay of the structure of the episodes themselves harked back to radio. Ken Swofferd is also fun as Frank Flannigan, a bombastic hack reporter.<br /><br />This is a nice, solid release of the series which includes the pilot film TOO MANY SUSPECTS. The episodes are sharp and crisp, with typical television sound of the time, which is not unpleasant. Definitely for classic mystery fans who don't mind a bit of whimsy, 1940s fans, and those who enjoy classic radio mystery stories."

Included in this 3-DVD set are a 30 minute core workourt, a 50 minute accelerated workout, and 2 10 minute workouts, the a.m. energizer and the p.m. destresser.  The practices are led by internationally-known yogi Rodney Yee and actress Mariel Hemingway, a long-time yoga practitioner.<br /><br />I began with the 30 minute workout.  Here Rodney and Mariel teach via live instruction a class of three students (one of whom is Rodney's girlfriend, yoga instructor Colleen Staidman).  The practice starts in a reclined position and focuses on breathing, then moves into stretches/core work including a reclined leg stretch, nose to knee, abdominals, and twists; a kneeling cat/cow sequence follows.  Next, you transition to standing, where you perform the three ""cardio"" moves.  The first is a full body arm swing performed with bent legs (fans of Callanetics will recognize this as one of her warm-up stretches).  Next comes a small hop move, with your arms swinging in front of you and your feet barely leaving the floor.  Finally, you will get down into a lunge position and quickly move from one leg to the other; this was the most strenuous of the three.  The standing postures included down dog, modified side angle, and a vinyasa series (down dog to plank to cobra/up dog), and the practice finishes with a quick cobbler's and relaxation poses.<br /><br />I found the 50 minute accelerated practice to be almost identical to the 30 minute, with only a few key differences: 1) Rodney and Mariel instruct via voiceover here, and 2) the cardio moves are repeated more frequently, and similarly, there are more frequent vinyasa series between each of the poses.  The opening floor sequence is virtually the same as the 30 minute practice.  Once you reach a standing position, you will do the arm swings and hops followed by a vinyasa, then triangle, chair pose, and another sequence of arm swings and hops.  After another vinyasa, you will do modified side angle, the arm swings, warrior 1, and then the lunges.  After returning to the arm swings and the hops followed by a vinyasa, you add warrior 2.  In a seated position, you perform a twist and a 1-legged forward bend; the practice ends with relaxation and a final seated meditation.<br /><br />The a.m. practice is led by Mariel alone instructing via voiceover.  She begins in staff pose, and she repeatedly emphasizes lengthening the waist.  She performs simple twists and a cat/cow series, and then she goes into all three cardio moves.  Standing poses include only down dog and warrior 2, and the practice ends in mountain pose.  Rodney leads the p.m. practice, also via voiceover.  This practice concentrates on a series of seated forward bends performed using a chair (you rest your arms and head on the chair).  There is also a reclined leg stretch using a strap and a nice relaxation pose with your legs on the chair to finish.  This set includes bonus materials as well, the best of which is a pose chart featuring clear, colorful illustrations of Mariel performing all of the featured postures (broken down into sun saluations, seated poses, standing poses, supine poses, and poses with the chair).  There is also a daily journal allowing you to record your progress, a nutrition plan (includes a ""core food"" guide, serving information, meal plans, and a grocery list), and a 2-week quick start meal plan.<br /><br />To my surprise, I found these workouts to be fairly enjoyable; Rodney and Mariel have a nice chemistry, and they worked well together, particularly when teaching live.  However, I definitely did NOT feel that the ""cardio"" moves included in these workouts were enough to provide any real aerobic benefit, and thus I don't see how anyone could lose weight with these videos (other than perhaps those who were completely sedentary to begin with).  I enjoyed the 10 minute practices the best; in the a.m. practice, the cardio moves do work well both to get the blood flowing and to wake up the body, and the p.m. practice was genuinely relaxing.  I also thought that the 30-minute core workout was a nice, basic level level yoga practice; again, the cardio moves helped to energize the body here.  The 50 minute workout was my least favorite, as I found it to be too repetitive.<br /><br />On the whole, this set was too easy for me, as I have been practicing yoga for several years now and consider myself to be at about an intermediate level.  I think that these workouts would be best suited to someone who has tried yoga before and has found it to be too slow or ""boring"" but who would also find ""power"" yoga to be too strenuous--Yoga Now bridges that gap, providing a different kind of energizing practice for yoga beginners."

Leslie Howard and Bette Davis offer memorable performances in this drama where a medical student is attracted to a promiscuous waitress with tragic consequences. This is based on the novel of Somerset Maugham who lived in Paris until he was ten, then educated at King's School, Canterbury, and at Heidelberg University He goes to study medicine in London and then start writing novels. The lead character Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) tries to become an artist in Paris and after being turned down, he goes to London and enrolls in a medical college. Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. While at Medical school he meets a sultry waitress named, Mildred Rogers; his passion and love for her carries him to the edge of self-destruction.  He becomes an instrument in the hands of a cold-hearted woman, and finds himself snubbed, and ridiculed. Her promiscuous nature does not teach Philip anything but leads him to a path of defeat and destruction.<br /><br />Somerset Maugham's novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters leaves lasting impression on him. The most notable are Norah (Kay Johnson) who offers him unquestionable love and care, and the Athlneys, Sally Athlney (Frances Dee) and Thorpe Athlney (Reginald Owen) has strong positive influence on him through their goodness and simplicity of life.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, penniless and stricken with tuberculosis, Mildred passes away and then Philip realizes what he is missing all along his life; the sweetness of a woman like Sally. This movie gave the opportunity for Bette Davis to be a star and influential people of Movie industry ran a campaign to have her name included for Academy award in 1934. She was only 26 when the film was completed and many moviegoers began to notice Bette Davis as a leading lady of Hollywood movies. During an interview Davis recalled that she didn't like Leslie Howard's treatment on the sets.  Director John Cromwell brings a certain amount charisma in handling the lack of chemistry between the two characters into a reality.<br /><br />1.

I am a figure artist and am inspired to use some of the techniques and new (to me) materials shown here to that end. And while the techniques and materials are exciting, fun, sexy and innovative, the road to improving one's art is work, experiment, practice and more practice; but having fun along the way is allowed.That is one of the core messages I got from this DVD.

Having said that- Thor fairs fairly well as far as this genre goes.  Primarily due to the character Loki and the brilliant actor who portrays him.<br /><br />Whether you are someone who lived under the shadow of a sibling or someone who felt lied to & betrayed by family.. whether you're someone who felt they weren't ever given a fair chance growing up or someone who was raised by a cold and restrictive parent.. or whether you were just someone who has felt like an outsider for much of their lives, chances are you're going to feel some sort of affinity toward Loki.  And lets face it.  This is going to mean a huge part of the population.  Is there any wonder people gravitate toward this character unlike any other?  Out of all the superhumans in the marvel universe thus far, Loki is by far the most human.<br /><br />Thor is an oaf who's idea of fun is literally pounding his way through things.  At the beginning especially, he is completely ruled by his ego and emotions. This changes somewhat through the course of the movie.  Though not necessarily stupid, Thor is not really intelligent either.  His idea of war includes no forethought and no strategy.  What Thor does have aside from his massive structure is a lot of heart and conviction so he's overall a decent human being with a strong sense of self.  Conversely Loki is a guy who thinks before he acts.  Though he has a mischevious side, he is very intelligent (and at least at first) is able to put aside his ego and emotions for the greater good-  that is until he finds out his entire life is a lie and he basically snaps.  At the risk of sounding like someone who is excusing Loki's very serious misdeeds- one might even go as far as to say that Loki's ""turn"" is merely an exercise in reaching out for another identity after he so abruptly lost his.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect by far.  In fact, if it weren't for Loki it would've been a bit of a throw-a-way like most other movies of this genre.  Chris Hemsworth makes a great Thor, but the script fails him sometimes.  The romance between Thor and Jane is difficult to swallow.  The idea that a brilliant physicist falls head over heels for a witless oaf like Thor (as he can be described in the beginning of the movie)  just because he fills out his shirt well is a hard sell and unfortunately, this film doesn't even bother to try to sell it.  Thor's interest in Jane is also a bit of a mystery as they have nothing in common. We're simply asked to accept this romance without ever being given any reason to care whether or not they come together - or stay together for that matter.  Some scenes were choppy.  Though not a perfect movie, it is by far the best superhero movie I've personally seen to date."

The bridge (Thor readers know what I mean) connecting Asgard and Earth, was like a bad disco floor against a backdrop that was busy with flashing lights. That's not only a technical problem, but also, poor design. While a rainbow bridge might have felt a little too ""Smurfy,"" work is still needed.<br /><br />Plot<br />The gist is Thor is about to be crowned king in a lavish ceremony. His rock star attitude is tolerate because he is basically a decent guy. It is disrupted by the Frost Giants. Loki convinces Thor to wage war against the wishes of Odin, and they, with a few others, go to kick some icicle tail.<br /><br />It gets seriously out of hand, and Odin banishes Thor to Earth. His hammer, the Mjolnir, is sent too, but only a man of Arthurian purity can pick it up. Thor's no longer fit to do it, nor can any of the humans who try. The sword, so to speak, stays in the stone.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Loki is provocating war in Asgard with the Frost Giants, claiming Odin is dead (he's not), and ascending to the throne.<br /><br />What happens next is why the movies matters.<br /><br />Overall, it works. In short, like Iron Man, Thor is a story of a powerful person let their arrogance cause havoc. He realizes it, is humbled, and uses his powers for good. Simple as that, and, on this level, it works.<br /><br />Weaknesses are in how they push the plot. For example: The romantic subplot is incomplete. Thor falls for Jane too deeply, too quickly. She's too easily accepting that he's a god.<br /><br />Loki's intentions go from sneaky, to evil, to confusing. I left the theater with no idea what he was trying to accomplish.<br /><br />It, more or less, follows the key Marvel comic book line. I won't go through the differences as the most not only needs to stand on its own, but comic are so often retconned (Retroactive continuity) to work in another era or media, it isn't worth deliberating.<br /><br />Casting<br />Chris Hemsworth as Thor - Completely Thor. Superhero films has suffered from brilliant and horrible casting (Brandon Routh as an effeminate, unmasculine Clark Kent/Superman was the worst). Not here. Hemsworth fit the suit, the attitude. He's sexy without being raunchy, arrogant yet likable, humble but not a wimp.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins as Odin - Wow. Think of this as compared to Marlon Brando as Superman's dad, Jor-El. Who would have thought they would do a comic book movie? Hopkins is completely believable as Odin. A few lines should have been rewritten (watch near the end for a ""should haven't been deleted Hallmark Afterschool Special"" scene), but he masters even the thinnest lines.<br /><br />Natalie Portman as Jane Foster - She works as the generic attractive brunette. You might not mind that she's there, but a half dozen other actresses could have stepped in.<br /><br />Tom Hiddleston as Loki - He fits it. Not so evil, but by no means good. His role is something that of the serpent in Eden. He is a tempter, liar and thief.<br /><br />Stellan Skarsgård as Dr. Erik Selvig - Like Portman, he did a fine, yet unremarkable job as Foster's mentor.<br /><br />To compare it to other superhero movies around that time: Iron Man and the Batman movies are more sophisticated, but also darker and for older audiences. It misses the banter and emo-romance of Spiderman, and retro-cheesy fun of Superman. That's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />americanspeechwriter.com"

There were a lot of reference scriptures to help you define prophecy and give examples of it, as well as who delivers the prophetic message and why. God has done an Amazing job getting HIS true Message out to HIS people through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.

I can forgive some of its sins because for me it delivered well enough.
