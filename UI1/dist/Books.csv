There, Tiffany carefully drew and painted the flowering trees, vines, flowers, and fauna that were the chief ornaments of his prized glass lamps. This sumptuous volume features 70 lamps, photographed by Colin Cooke using his own specially developed techniques that reveal Tiffany’s mastery of glassmaking and metal work. The authors relate the chief decorative themes in Tiffany’s masterpieces to the work of other fin-de-siècle glassmakers and outline the making of Tiffany’s lamps, from freehand sketch to elegant finished form.Praise for', 'The Lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany:', '""The publication of', 'The Lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany', 'is a dazzling roundup of some of the beauties.

Imagine my delight when I learned that the publisher had reissued THE LAMPS OF LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY in this smaller-format hardcover edition at a much more affordable $35 retail price! (Both editions are available for less than full retail price on Amazon.) This smaller-format edition of the book is 10.4"" x 8.7"" x 1"" and weighs 3 lbs.--in contrast to the original edition, which is 12.3"" x 10.1"" x 1.1"" inches and weighs 4.2 lbs.<br /><br />The photographs in this smaller-format book are gorgeous, and I doubt that either the photos or the text have suffered much, if at all, from the downsizing.  In fact, the less-hefty book is much easier to handle, if you're interested in actually reading the text, or in studying the lamp photographs closely.<br /><br />What I like most about this book is that it shows the complete lamps:  the lamps have both the Tiffany glass shades (e.g., Wisteria, Daffodil, Cobweb, Dragonfly) and the elaborate, organic, metal bases that Tiffany created to perfectly complement the shades. I also love the close-ups of portions of the shades, which reveal the qualities of the individual glass pieces that went into the shades.  And I enjoy inspecting the various photos of the Tiffany workshops, the Tiffany craftspeople, and Tiffany's homes.<br /><br />The book includes three background articles:  ""Tiffany's Studies of Lighting"" by Martin Eidelberg; ""Nature Is Always Beautiful"" by Martin Eidelberg; ""An Alliance of Arts and Crafts: Creating a Tiffany Leaded Shade"" by Martin Eidelberg and Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen.  However, the bulk of the book consists of a photo gallery of beautiful Tiffany lamps, with each lamp discussed in scholarly but readable commentary: ""Important Lamps by Louis Comfort Tiffany:  Lamps selected by Nancy A. McClelland and Lars Rachen, Commentary by Martin Eidelberg."
"Stashbuster Knits: Tips, Tricks, and 21 Beautiful Projects for Using Your Favorite Leftover Yarn",4.4,5.0,2011-11-16 23:57:04.000,14.71,"['There’s no such thing as too much yarn. \xa0 As renowned knitwear designer Melissa Leapman knows all too well, every knitter has a stash of yarn that they just can’t bear to part with: the one or two extra balls of yarn bought “just in case,” or the bits and pieces leftover from completed projects.', 'Stashbuster Knits', 'gives you the absolute best way to use—and enjoy—your treasured yarn collection guilt free. Leapman offers valuable step-by-step guidance on organizing and shopping your stash to inspire creative new knitting ideas and color combinations. Then she gives you 21 ingenious projects for men, women, children, and home that are designed so no one will ever guess they were made from odds and ends. Included are projects both large and small, from a glorious Fair Isle sweater for your favorite guy to a chic little scarf made with a Magic Ball. Each yarn weight has its own chapter, from super fine to super bulky, ensuring that knitters will find a way to use every piece of stored-up yarn. Filled with tips and hints on customizing projects and ideas to use even the tiniest bits of yarn, Leapman’s', 'Stashbuster Knits', 'will help transform your beloved stash into projects you’ll love even more. \xa0 So dive into your closets, dig into your bins, rifle through your drawers, and bring your precious yarn out of hiding.

The yarn is too good to throw out, but there's not enough to actually make anything.  However, this book solves the problem, with its many patterns for projects so well designed that, as author Melissa Leapman says, ""no one will ever know these projects were made from leftovers!""<br /><br />The attractive projects include (1) a charted ""jigsaw puzzle piece"" baby blanket; (2) geometrically-patterned bangle bracelets; (3) striped mittens, scarves, shawls, throws, and sweaters; (4) striped and patterned shopping, sample, and tote bags; (5) a Fair Isle yoked sweater and a Fair Isle vest; and (6) many single-color hats.  The projects are grouped in the book according to the yarn weights used:  fine, lightweight, worsted, or chunky.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is the lengthy introduction that discusses sorting yarns leftovers by weight and color, to ensure the best possible combinations for successful knitted fabrics.  Several pages, illustrated with color wheels, explain the scientific theory of color--including how to get good results from monochromatic color combinations, and from combinations of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 colors.  The book also includes explanations of how to join yarns together using standard knitting techniques, or using the ""Russian join"" (which uses a tapestry needle).  There is a nice discussion of how to put together a ""Magic Ball"" of short lengths of leftover yarns of different colors and textures (the ball is knitted up like regular yarn); as well as some discussion of yarn storage.<br /><br />Nearly all of the projects are fairly easy to knit.  (The Fair Isle garments, the intarsia sample bag, and the charted puzzle-piece blanket will require moderate knitting experience).  Note, though, that whether you will have enough yarn already on hand to knit many of the larger projects will depend entirely on the actual size and makeup of your personal yarn stash!  For me, this book rates an unqualified 5 stars."

New to me author. I ordered this title because I liked the cover, now I am going back to the library in hopes of ordering the NINE other titles in the series - I read the summaries of the previous titles in the series to help me figure out what was what - I included them below for anyone who mught be new to the series:<br /><br />Cast in Shadow Book #1 (2006): Seven years ago Kaylin fled the crime-riddled streets of Nightshade, knowing that something was after her. Children were being murdered, and all had the same odd markings that mysteriously appeared on her own skin. Since then, she's learned to read, she's learned to fight and she's become one of the vaunted Hawks who patrol and police the City of Elantra. Alongside the winged Aerians and immortal Barrani, she's made a place for herself, far from the mean streets of her birth. But children are once again dying, and a dark and familiar pattern is emerging, Kaylin is ordered back into Nightshade with a partner she knows she can't trust, a Dragon lord for a companion and a device to contain her powers, powers that no other human has. Her task is simple, find the killer, stop the murders, and survive the attentions of those who claim to be her allies!<br /><br />Cast in Courtlight Book 2 (2007): In Elantra, a job well done is rewarded with a more dangerous task. And so, after defeating a dark evil, Kaylin must enter a place of deceit and treachery. A world where silk and jewels hide deadly secrets. Kaylin goes before the Barrani High Court, where a misspoken word brings sure death. And Kaylin's never been known for her grace or manners. But the High Lord's heir is suspiciously ill and Kaylin's healing magic is the only shot at saving him, if she manages to dodge the traps laid for her. Only to discover that the healing might turn out to be the simplest of the tasks before her.<br /><br />Cast in Secret, Book 3 (2008): Still avoiding magic whenever possible, Private Kaylin Neya relished investigating a run-of-the-mill theft. Until she found out the mysterious stolen box had been taken from Elani Street, where the mages and charlatans mingled, and it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between the two. And since the box was ancient, without a keyhole, and held tremendous darkness inside, Kaylin knew unknown forces were again playing with her destiny--and her life.<br /><br />Cast in Fur, Book 4 (2008): When a minority race of telepaths is suspected of causing a near-devastating tidal wave, Private Kaylin Neya is summoned to Court and into a PR nightmare. To ease racial tensions, the emperor has commissioned a play, and the playwright has his own ideas about who should be the focus. But Kaylin works her best magic behind the scenes, and though she tries to stay neutral, she is again drawn into a world of politics and murder. To make matters worse, Marcus, her trusted sergeant, gets stripped of his command, leaving Kaylin vulnerable. Now she's juggling two troubling cases, and even magic's looking good by comparison. But then nobody ever said life in the theater was easy.<br /><br />Cast in Silence, Book 5 (2009): A member of the elite Hawk force that protects the City of Elantra, Kaylin Neya has sacrificed much to earn the respect of the winged Aerians and immortal Barrani she works alongside. But the mean streets she escaped as a child aren't the ones she's vowed to give her life guarding. Those were much darker. Kaylin's moved on with her life and is keeping silent about the shameful things she's done to stay alive. But when the city's oracles warn of brewing unrest in the outer fiefdoms, a mysterious visitor from Kaylin's past casts her under a cloud of suspicion. Thankfully, if she's anything, she's a survivor.<br /><br />Cast in Chaos, Book 6 (2010): Kaylin Neya is a Hawk, part of the elite force tasked with keeping the City of Elantra safe. Her past is dark, her magic uncontrolled and her allies unpredictable. And nothing has prepared her for what is coming, when the charlatans on Elani Street suddenly grow powerful, the Oracles are thrown into an uproar and the skies rain blood. The powerful of Elantra believe that the mysterious markings on Kaylin's skin hold the answer, and they are not averse to using her, how ever they have to, in order to discover what it is. Something is coming, breaking through the barriers between the worlds. But is it a threat that Kaylin needs to defend her city against or has she been chosen for another reason entirely?<br /><br />Cast in Ruin, Book 7 (2011): Seven corpses are discovered in the streets of a Dragon's fief. All identical, down to their clothing. Kaylin Neya is assigned to discover who they were, who killed them, and why. Is the evil lurking at the borders of Elantra preparing to cross over? At least the investigation delays her meeting with the Dragon Emperor. And as the shadows grow longer over the fiefs, Kaylin must use every skill she's ever learned to save the people she's sworn to protect. Sword in hand, dragons in the sky, this time there's no retreat and no surrender.<br /><br />Cast in Peril, Book 8 (2012): It has been a busy few weeks for Private Kaylin Neya. In between angling for a promotion, sharing her room with the last living female Dragon and dealing with more refugees than anyone knew what to do with, the unusual egg she'd been given began to hatch. Actually, that turned out to be lucky, because it absorbed the energy from the bomb that went off in her quarters. So now might be the perfect time to leave Elantra and journey to the West March with the Barrani. If not for the disappearances of citizens in the fief of Tiamaris, disappearances traced to the very Barrani Kaylin is about to be traveling with.<br /><br />Cast in Sorrow, Book 9 (2013): The Barrani would be happy to see her die. So Kaylin Neya is a bit surprised by her safe arrival in the West March. Especially when enemies new and old surround her and those she would call friends are equally dangerous. And then the real trouble starts. Kaylin's assignment is to be a ""harmoniste"" (one who helps tell the truth behind a Barrani Recitation). But in a land where words are more effective than weapons, Kaylin's duties are deadly. With the wrong phrase she could tear a people further asunder. And with the right ones, well, then she might be able to heal a blight on a race. If only she understood the story."
Meat Eater: Adventures from the Life of an American Hunter,4.8,4.0,2012-11-25 02:52:05.000,49.0,"['“Revelatory . . . With every chapter, you get a history lesson, a hunting lesson, a nature lesson and a cooking lesson. . . .', 'Meat Eater', 'offers an overabundance to savor.”—', 'The New York Times Book Review', 'Steven Rinella grew up in Twin Lake, Michigan, the son of a hunter who taught his three sons to love the natural world the way he did. As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts.', 'Meat Eater', 'chronicles Rinella’s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska.  \xa0 Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do. \xa0 A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Rinella also includes after each chapter a section of “Tasting Notes” that draws from his thirty-plus years of eating and cooking wild game, both at home and over a campfire.

I have recently discovered that the author is intending to release another book, and from what I understand it will continue where this one left off. I am thankful for this, as the way this book ended was definitely a negative for me. I wanted to know more! What happened to the author, did she learn what she came to learn? Did she get the job she was hoping for? So many questions.<br /><br />From the beginning of Linda's book, it is easy to love her. She is open, honest and definitely has the type of personality you want your heroine to have, whether the book is fiction or reality. I couldn't help but root for Linda throughout her trials with her host family, even when I thought she acted as a bit of a brat herself. Listening to her internal thoughts about what she went through and her desire to achieve her goals made this book feel close to my heart.<br /><br />I applaud the adventurous spirit of the author and her decision to keep journal entries from that chapter of her life. What great material to have later to inspire a book! While I enjoyed the entire memoir, my favourite part of this book would have to be the author's descriptions of the many places she visited and the people she met along the way. While I think she could definitely have made a better impression on the family she worked for if she had been honest about her lack of French language skills from the beginning, she is a pioneer. Her drive and desire to learn the language from those in the actual country was inspiring. Not many people would have been gutsy enough to do what Linda did.<br /><br />I also particularly enjoyed the relationship between Linda and Antoine. The Kind heart of the author was apparent in her actions toward the children, even when she struggled with them.<br /><br />There is some romance, and I appreciated the way the author handled it. While sex scenes are not necessarily automatically offensive, there is something about memoirs that makes me uncomfortable if they are filled with them. This author manages to hint at her experiences without going into too much detail, leaving the reader to decide exactly what happened. Great writing.<br /><br />When you step into reading this book, you learn a lot about French customs, French cuisine and wine. You also get the opportunity to brush up on your French skills a bit and get to step outside yourself and live an adventure through the eyes of the author. I read this book in one sitting with very few breaks in between and found myself enthralled in the sights, sounds and atmosphere of this memoir.<br /><br />In the end, I was disappointed that the book ended. I could have kept reading about Linda's experiences without stopping anytime in the foreseeable future. The end of the book leaves many unanswered questions, that I am assuming the author will be answering in her next book. Were this a standalone, I would be very disappointed with the way the book ended, but with the knowledge that she is writing another book to continue with her story, I can't fault this one. One thing is for sure, if you read this book, you will be anxiously awaiting the next.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes books about travel, memoirs or just a good story that came from the recollections and heart of the author. Read it, you will be glad you did. Overall, this was a VERY enjoyable read that gave me many reasons to wish I could drop everything and head off to France!"

I'd put it at the top of my imaginary list of the best first chapters I've read this year.  But from the second chapter out it lags.  I wanted to love this story.  I got so excited when I read about this book on a favorite fantasy blog.  I ran up to my husband with excited squeals of, well, excitement, 'there's a book coming out that has nazi super villains against British warlocks, yeahhh!'  He gave me a bored look and quoted a list of comic book storylines similar to this, but I didn't care (and kinda didn't believe him) because the plot sounded so inspired and fun to me.<br /><br />It isn't fun and all it inspired me to do was to reread The Lies of Locke Lamora and The Hobbit to minimize my disappointment.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is as fabulous a story as you will ever read, but actually following the story is terribly dull.<br /><br />Let's start with the main characters;  Marsh and Will.<br /><br />Marsh, who is stereotypically stolid, brave and strong (also, a real hit with the ladies) has a romance with Olivia (which is skipped, of course).  Romance being a no no in stories about WWII and other action-y stuff.  I can accept that, but the long build up before Marsh actually does anything besides mention how mysterious things are, was boring.  I have a low tolerance for the big B and wading through dull meetings between, Will and Marsh.  Marsh and his contact at the War Office,  Marsh and the dude who gave him a ride, was as blah as it sounds.<br /><br />Now onto to Will.  Will is a peer of the realm, (for some bizarro reason I kept thinking of Ashley from Gone With the Wind, but that's just me, I'm sure he was more manly than Scarlett's forbidden love).  He's also pretty fly with the girls and has a family with a mysterious talent who he's had a falling out with for reasons that are hinted at until almost the middle of the book.<br /><br />The story shows signs of nonsensical delays as you get hints about warlocks, but nothing definitive about what they are, what they can do and why the hell they haven't offered to help before now.<br /><br />On the plus side, the super powered nazi kids are much better represented,  I didn't have to stop and think to figure out who was who when the story flipped over to their part.  I even felt bad for them, they had such an exploited and tortuous life.  Their part of the story was much more interesting and dare I say, exciting?<br /><br />Anyway, I guess you should read this book for yourself.  My complaints are more of a stylistic nature than a content problem.  I like a little more spice to my books and this just didn't do it for me."

In my fantasy world's mind, if I make a swatch, determine gauge, I could create my own, unique garment or accessory with the stitch Bible. How I'd get from my current level to that point would require dedication and practice. As one reviewer stated, these patterns are are best served when knitter uses fine yarn and small needles. As a typical, laterally improving US knitter, I generally go for fast, worsted, slightly difficult patterns. Patterns in Japanese far surpass that level, in general. There are some easier, but that wouldn't get me to point B. I'd print out a chart at a magnified state and color code it. This book makes this other new book by We are Knitters, look like a third grader's knitting manual. These patterns are, indeed, exquisite. What kind of virtouso, genius is Hitomi Shida? Wendy Barnard's book, Japanese Stitches Unraveled, is likely a good way to get started. Cross match for similar patterns, and make a hat. All books, mentioned above, are available here. Lastly, if a particular stitch seems impossible, don't forget you tube for a resource. To make a hat in the round, single out the basic pattern from a chart, only add one side of border design. Knit all knits. Purl all purls. Only pick designs with plain wrong side rows. Plan decreases before starting for continuity."

As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts.', 'Meat Eater', 'chronicles Rinella’s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska.  \xa0 Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do. \xa0 A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Rinella also includes after each chapter a section of “Tasting Notes” that draws from his thirty-plus years of eating and cooking wild game, both at home and over a campfire.

I think of what the cows and chickens made into dog kibble went through, and what diseases they might have had before being in a can of cat food.<br /><br />That being said, I'm always interested in different perspectives about hunting, lifestyles, and philosophies.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book quite a bit because it contains all of the above. There seem to be so many books about hunting, magazines about hunting. Books on bow hunting, and dialogue about hunting a mule deer as opposed to a white tailed deer. I felt like this book fills a gap that had not been covered in any of the articles or books I had previously read.<br /><br />Because I am passionate about knowing where my food comes from, and doing even a small part to make choices that are responsible, it was refreshing and affirming to read the author's perspective. When we grab a fast food hamburger, we don't think about the suffering animal that probably led an unnatural life, and we certainly don't think of the workers in the processing plants that do a job so brutal and often dangerous. This book reminds us to respect the food we eat, something that comes more naturally when you are closer to your food, closer to the animal that gives its life."
